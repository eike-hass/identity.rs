# Changelog

## [v0.5.0-dev.3](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/tree/v0.5.0-dev.3) (2022-01-25)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/compare/v0.5.0-dev.2...v0.5.0-dev.3)
 
This release introduces a breaking change for diff updates created by versions `v0.5.0-dev.1` and `v0.5.0-dev.2` (previous diff updates from `<=v0.4.0` are already incompatible due to breaking changes to the document and message structure in `v0.5.0-dev.1`). To migrate, please publish an integration update containing all diff changes to prevent unexpected changes to resolved DID Documents.

## [v0.5.0-dev.2](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/tree/v0.5.0-dev.2) (2022-01-14)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/compare/v0.5.0-dev.1...v0.5.0-dev.2)

## [v0.5.0-dev.1](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/tree/v0.5.0-dev.1) (2021-12-15)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0-dev.1)
 
This release introduces multiple breaking changes to the structure of IOTA DID Documents and their Tangle messages, rendering any identity created with a prior version incompatible and unresolvable. A versioning system has been introduced so any new identities should hopefully be forward compatible with any future breaking changes to the message structure.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/tree/v0.4.0) (2021-11-01)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/eike-hass/identity.rs/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0)

This release introduces the high-level `Account` API for creating and managing IOTA identities.
